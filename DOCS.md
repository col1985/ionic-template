## Documentation

Documentation is generated by leveraging the use of git-hooks and and a documentation tool called [TypeDoc](http://typedoc.org/). This is the final step in the commit process provided the the first 2 steps have completed successfully. The documentation output is in a website format and can be located in the `/docs` directory, at the root of the project.

To manually generate/ update the `/docs` directory run the following command

```bash
npm run docs
```
