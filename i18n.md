+ **Documentation:** [here](https://angular.io/guide/i18n)

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---|---|

| Support for custom id on targeted elements | No support for Observables or Events |
| JIT support | JIT support requires all translations  at application bootstrap |

## Ngx-translate

+ **Site:** [here](https://angular.io/guide/i18n)
+ **API Documentation:** [here](https://angular.io/guide/i18n)

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---|---|
| More complete set of APIs ie. Observables, Events supported | HTML support only, no Angular syntax support |
| JSON supported out of the box | Author currently working with Angular team to integrate with Angular Core, expect in Angular 5, potential future migration issues |
| Custom loader support | ICU expressions not supported |
| HTTP or FS loaders provided | Angular i18n support is more performant |
| Executed at runtime | |
| Language support via bindings i.e. dynamic language support | |
| Template and code support | |

### Summary

The feature rich support provided out of the box by the ngx-translate library, coupled with the ability to allow the user dynamically change language selection during application runtime rather than a force reload of the application, makes a strong case choosing this library.

However, future support of the library by the author or any potential migration effort to i18n support in Angular 5 is a current unknown.
